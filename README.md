# Task

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZxVcaiZp5-TJ52KSv37DwiuotQTlpIv4OpVW9nUkZjg/edit?usp=sharing Here is the Summer project brief 

Please read through it and reach out regarding any questions you might have. It is really important you understand what you need to do.

The deadline for the project is at the end of August/beginning of September. We expect you send us a zip file containing your project solution or a link to GitHub where your repo is stored.
That sounds like plenty of time but take the project seriously and start working on the project immediately.
